Crop Recommendation System

A Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning–based application designed to help farmers choose the most suitable crop for cultivation based on environmental and soil conditions.

It works in the following way:

Input Data – The farmer provides information such as soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

Processing – The system uses a trained machine learning model that analyzes the given inputs.

Prediction – Based on the model, the system predicts which crop (like rice, wheat, maize, cotton, etc.) is best suited for those conditions.

Recommendation – It gives a clear suggestion to the farmer, helping them make better decisions for maximum yield.

✅ Goal: Increase productivity, reduce risks, and make farming more efficient using data-driven decisions.
